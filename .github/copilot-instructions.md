## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't create new patterns when existing ones work
- ❌ Don't skip validation because "it should work"  
- ❌ Don't ignore failing tests - fix them
- ❌ Don't use sync functions in async context
- ❌ Don't hardcode values that should be config
- ❌ Don't catch all exceptions - be specific
